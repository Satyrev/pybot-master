# PyBot 08/19/2020- 11/12/2022 Code was transfered from my personal account
### this bot isn't being developed and bugs likely won't be patched. this was a project to learn how to code a python only bot. 
## Features
- Sends a message whenever someone joins
- Sends a message whenever someone leaves
- Essential moderation commands
- A couple of fun commands (8ball, calculator, roulette and more)
- Custom Help command
## Note
- code might be messy and I haven't added cogs
- the code is open source now because this was a project made for "python only" and i'm probably going to make a new better bot mixed with python and node.js.
